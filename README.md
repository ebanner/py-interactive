## Quick Start

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ebanner/pynt.git
echo '(load-file "~/pynt/pynt/pynt.el")' >> .emacs
pip install --user jupyter epc
emacs my-python-file.py
M-x pynt-mode RET
```

## What is pynt?

pynt is fundamentally a python to jupyter notebook (`.py` to `.ipynb`) converter.

pynt takes a python file and produces a jupyter notebook. The resulting jupyter notebook can be opened in a [jupyter notebook web browser client](#jupyter-notebook-web-browser-client) or within emacs with a [Emacs IPython Notebook client](https://github.com/ebanner/pynt/blob/dev/README.md#emacs-ipython-notebook-client).

In addition an emacs package called `pynt-mode` is included. `pynt-mode` provides an interface for invoking pynt as well as tooling for making the transition from code and jupyter notebook (and vice-versa) seamless (i.e. by scrolling jupyter cells with lines of code).

One way to think about pynt is it is a tool which produces a *dynamic* (or *live*) log. A dynamic log is in contrast to a *static* (or *dead*) log which you could produce by, say, inserting print statements between each line of your code. pynt does this automatically *without you having to modify the existing code*.

Yet another way to think about pynt is as a debugger. But rather than operating at one line at a time (as with traditional debuggers) you have access to *every line of code at all times*.

## What are pynt use cases?

pynt shines in the following two scenarios:

1. Acquainting/familiarizing yourself with someone else's code
2. Modifying your code
3. Producing documentation to familiarize someone else with your code

Regarding new code, a common workflow of mine is to paste the code into a jupyter notebook, split up each line of code into its own cell, and evaluate each cell to see the effect of each line of code. *This is exactly what pynt does*.

Regarding familiar (existing) code, pynt allows you to, say, modify an existing line of code, evaluate that line, and visually verify that it produces the desired data/output. This is in contrast to editing a line of code, invoking the code (i.e. by calling the surrounding function), and inspecting the output of the function.

Regarding producing documentation, since pynt mixes markdown with code and data, it can serve as a piece of documentation to hand off to someone so they can quickly get up to speed with how the code works.

## Using pynt

Once you have opened a python file and `pynt-mode` is active you should select the region of code you would like to create a jupyter notebook out of (by popping over to the notebook buffer and cycling through the available namespaces with the `<left>` and `<right>` arrow keys) then hitting `C-c C-e`.

It is suggested at this point to enable `pynt-scroll-mode` to scroll the notebook buffer with the code lines. You can activate `pynt-scroll-mode` with `M-x pynt-scroll-mode RET`.
