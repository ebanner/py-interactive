## What is pynt?

pynt is fundamentally a python to jupyter notebook (`.py` to `.ipynb`) converter.

pynt takes a python file and produces a jupyter notebook. The resulting jupyter notebook can be opened in a [jupyter notebook web browser client](#jupyter-notebook-web-browser-client) or within emacs with a [Emacs IPython Notebook client](https://github.com/ebanner/pynt/blob/dev/README.md#emacs-ipython-notebook-client).

In addition to this converter an emacs package called `pynt-mode` is provided which provides an interface for issuing this transformation as well as tooling for making the transition from code and jupyter notebook (and vice-versa) seamless.

Another way to think about pynt is as a tool which produces a *dynamic* (or *live*) log. A dynamic log is in contrast to a *static* (or *dead*) log which you could produce by, say, inserting print statements between each line of your code. pynt does this automatically *without you having to insert logging statements*.

Yet another way to think about pynt is as a debugger. But rather than operating at one line at a time (as with traditional debuggers) you have access to *every line of code*.

## Prerequisites

- Emacs
- jupyter (python)
- EIN [[1]](http://millejoh.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/) and [[2]](https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook)
- epc (python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to `/your/local/path/pynt`
2. Add `(load-file "/your/local/path/pynt/code/pynt.el")` to your `.emacs` file

## Using pynt

The first step is starting EIN just like you normally would. My workflow for that is the following.

1. Do `M-x pynt-mode RET` on a python file
2. Pop over to the jupyter notebook and cycle through the namespaces with the `<left>` and `<right>` arrow keys
3. Once you've decided on a namespace pop back over to the code and then hit `C-c C-e` or `M-x pynt-execute-current-namespace RET`
4. Optionally toggle `M-x pynt-scroll-mode RET` to make the generated notebook scroll with your point
